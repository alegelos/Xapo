# Xapo iOS project

This is a project used to evaluate candidate's coding skills and iOS knowledge.

# Description

The projectâ€™s idea is to list trending projects from Github, tap on one of them, and show their details.
The first screen of the app is described on this [Figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/5JrLNhD1etjj9FIfmpwe93/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1) .

For the other screens you are free to choose the appearance of the app, the most you follow Apple guidelines, the better. You can take as example of design the AppStore app (it's just an idea, you decide). The better the app looks, the more interest we see that you have in the position :)

## Requirements

- Write your application in Swift.
- Ensure your application is compatible with the latest version of iOS. (The layout of the screens must work on all supported iOS 15 devices).
- Use good architecture and design patterns, SOLID principles.
- Use SwiftUI and some animations are a big plus.
- The project needs to work just running it (CMD+R)  - Keep it simple :)

*Bonus*: Unit tests, UI tests, no overengineering, animations, ...

If there is something not specified, please be free to decide on it. Let us know if you need something, or you have any doubt about the project.

# Handover

Whenever you are done, just create a release in github or contact HR!
